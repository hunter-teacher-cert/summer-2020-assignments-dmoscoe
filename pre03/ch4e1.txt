1. When ping is invoked, it prints a period and starts a new line.
When baffle is invoked, it prints "wug" and then invokes ping.

The output of the program is:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

2. A stack diagram shows a frame containing each method's parameters
and variables at a specific instant. But the methods here contain no
parameters or variables. So the boxes to the right of each method's name
are empty. The methods invoked in order are:

main   [     ]
zoop   [     ]
baffle [     ]
ping   [     ]

3. Invoking baffle at the end of ping would prevent the program from
ending. That's because baffle in turn invokes ping, which would in turn
invoke baffle again. This pattern of invocations, baffle-ping-baffle-ping...
would repeat forever.
